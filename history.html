        <h2>Histroy of Treaty 1</h2>
        <h3>Thousands Of People Gathered In <span class="names">Lower Fort Garry</span></h3>
        <p>
          people gathered for the treaty 1 negotiations that happend in
          <span class="names">Lower Fort Garry</span> (just north of
          <span class="names">Winnipeg</span>) back in August, 1871. the negotiations took around
          nine days to compleate.
        </p>
        <p>Fun Fact: there was a newspaper from america that came to witness the negotiations</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Historic Promises</h3>
        <p>
          Each man, woman and child is to be given a gratuity. or a one time payment of $3, and $15
          per family of five yearly. the government agreed to build and maintain a school on each
          reserve. and to prohibit the sale of liquor on reserves each band was to receive a large
          amount of land, 160 acres to be exact.
        </p>
        <p>Fun Fact: $15 dollars in 1871 is worth $306.12 today (CAD)</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why Is Treaty 1 Importent</h3>
        <p>
          treaty 1 helped establish <span class="names">western canada</span>. there was a
          delcoration that says the treaty will be in place for "as long as the sun shines, the
          grass grows and the river flows.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How Treaties Affect Us Today</h3>
        <p>
          they provide a way for people to live together and sharing land that was origionaly
          occupied by the <span class="names">first nations</span> people. they help operate
          poeration, partnership and reconciliation. they also help spread diffrent cultures around
          <span class="names">manitoba</span> and <span class="names">canada</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Urban Reserves</h3>
        <p>What are urban reserves</p>
        <p>
          urban reserves are reserves within a urban area (like a city). urban reserves are all over
          <span class="names">Manitoba</span>, like <span class="names">Portage La Prairie</span>,
          <span class="names">Polo park</span> and now on <span class="names">kenaston</span>. most
          reserves are in rural areas where they are far away from big citys like
          <span class="names">Winnipeg</span> where there are hundreds of job oppertunitys. with
          urban reserves it gives <span class="names">first nations</span> people who live on
          reserves more of a chance to have jobs and still live on traditional native-land.
